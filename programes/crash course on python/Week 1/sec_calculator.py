#Keeping in mind there are 86400 seconds per day, write a program that calculates how many seconds there are in a week, if a week is 7 days. Print the result on the screen.

#Note: Your result should be in the format of just a number, not a sentence.

secInMin = 60
secInHour = 60 * secInMin
secInDay = 24 * secInHour
secInWeek = 7 * secInDay
